# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
A deep learning project to classify chest X-ray images into **Pneumonia** or **Normal**, using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Built and trained using the Kaggle [Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset, this model aims to support early detection of pneumonia via automated diagnosis.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- Includes over **5,000** X-ray images labeled as `PNEUMONIA` or `NORMAL`.

## üìå Project Objectives
- Build a CNN-based image classifier to detect pneumonia.
- Preprocess image data and handle class imbalance.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- Visualize learning using training curves and Grad-CAM (optional).
- Highlight the role of AI in medical diagnostics.
